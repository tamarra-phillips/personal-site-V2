            My current passion is UX reasearch. Deep diving into the analytics of a page or a promotional campaign to see what is converting.
            Setting up heatmaps and session recording to gain a greater understanding of how a user is interacting with a page or email.
            A/B testing to get feedback from customers in an indirect manner. Using the results that best serves the customer. Data driven decisions are the best decisions.

            HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript, jQuery with some Angular and a tiny ammount of C#. I have always enjoyed the more visual sides of coding.
            I like that I can write a little code, save and instantly see the changes that I have made. There is so much more to quality front end code than the languages you are writing in.
            You have to be mindful of SEO. Pay attention to Meta Tags and Schema when needed. Know your analytics strategy and create items for tracking accordingly.

            Every year of my career has has a focus on responsive websites.
            Browser and device testing to ensure that your site gives the best possible impression no matter how the user is viewing it could be considered an art.
            All browsers have their own little quirks and can be a treat to troubleshoot. No sarcasm intented. Who doesn't love a good puzzle.

            I have tried hard to be a jack of all trades when it comes to the world of UI/UX. While I have spent a lot of time in the land of the Dev, I enjoy creating wireframes, mockups and promotional creative when I have the ability.
            One of my recent favorite projects had me creating a bussiness card for a computer building small business.
            You can see an example of the card on the <a href="/portfolio.html#Misc" title="Portfolio Misc Section">portfolio page under Miscellaneous</a>

            While email creation and campaing management is not currently a part of my daily work, I do have plenty of experience. While working at TTI, I ended up managing all the email campaigns for the European branch.
            This included adding new contacts, making new lists, developing layouts, making the creative, getting approvals and scheduling the sends.
            The only thing I was ever not managing was the text as it was often in a language I was not fluent in.
